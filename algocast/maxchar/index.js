// --- Directions
// Given a string, return the character that is most
// commonly used in the string.
// --- Examples
// maxChar("abcccccccd") === "c"
// maxChar("apple 1231111") === "1"

//let maxChar = '' and maxCount = 1
//loop through charMap hash
//if charMap at char <= maxCount
//asign maxCount = charMap at char
//else found maxCount and maxChar = char
