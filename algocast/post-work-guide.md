# JavaScript Postwork Plan

## Track Goal

By the end of this track, you should feel more confidence in your JavaScript programming and the request response cycle. You'll be able to build a React/Redux/Rails CRUD application, explain REST and the Request/Response cycle, and generally solve some cool problems using JavaScript.

## Sequence of Events

The following activities should be completed in order.

### Request Response Cycle

One of the foundational pieces of knowledge for any web developer is the request response cycle. Understanding this is crucial to your career.

- Sinatra NYC Lab
  - This lab covers all of the different types of HTTP requests and sets up their RESTful actions. Because you're using Sinatra instead of Rails, you'll have to write our your forms and routes by hand.

### Object Oriented JavaScript

Understanding how a language works is just as important, if not more so, then understanding a framework. How can we write JavaScript applications if we don't really know JavaScript? So let's spend some time reviewing OO JavaScript principles.

- Creating Objects Lab
- Inheritance Patterns Lab
- Methods/Classes Lab
- Space Invaders Lab
- Robot Simulator Lab
  - These labs are the core of our OO JavaScript curriculum. If you already finished them but feel a little bit shaky, do them again. These will make you into a better JavaScript Programmer.
- BONUS: [You Don't Know JS](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/tree/master/this%20%26%20object%20prototypes)
  - Want to take a deeper dive on OO JavaScript? This book is beloved by many Flatiron School graduates.

### Functional JavaScript

Same as above - let's really understand JavaScript before we start work on a framework.

- forEach Lab
- Map Lab
- Reduce Lab
- Pure Functions Lab
- BONUS: Map/Reduce Lab
  - These labs discuss what JavaScript's iterators actually do for us. This section also gets into pure functions - functions that return the same thing, every time, with no side effects. This is a really important concept in Redux.

### Project Time

Now that you've had some good practice with JavaScript, it's time to build stretch out your knowledge by building a project.

#### Requirements

1. Your project must have a Rails backend with a React/Redux frontend.
2. You must have at least two models with one join Model.
3. The user should be able to perform full CRUD actions on one of the resources.
4. Use Bootstrap of Materialize to implement a basic layout.
5. Come up with one 'Stretch' feature for when the basic feature is complete. Maybe you can do a cool data visualization using some stats from your data, or do some text analysis on some of your blog posts.
